# Statistical Data Analysis: Solving Time Performance & Learning Curves

This repository contains the final project for the **Probability Theory and Statistics** course (June 2023). The project focuses on statistical inference and predictive modeling using **IBM SPSS**, analyzing the performance and learning patterns of players in a word-puzzle game.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The study analyzes two datasets: `timeA` (Player A, experienced) and `timeB` (Student, new player). The goal is to compare performance metrics and model the "learning effect" over time through linear regression.

## 🛠 Methodology & Tools
* **Software:** IBM SPSS Statistics
* **Statistical Techniques:**
    * **Descriptive Analysis:** Boxplots, Histograms, and measures of central tendency/dispersion.
    * **Hypothesis Testing:** Independent and Paired T-tests to compare mean solving times.
    * **Confidence Intervals:** 95% CI for population means and variances.
    * **Linear Regression:** Modeling solving time as a function of experience (days played).
    * **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficient ($\rho$) for trend identification.

## 📋 Key Findings
* **Comparative Performance:** Analysis of whether Player A is significantly faster than Player B using hypothesis testing.
* **Learning Curve:** Development of the Least Squares regression line to predict future performance.
* **Trend Shifts:** Investigation of how the learning rate changes after the initial 75 days of experience.
* **Model Validation:** Critical evaluation of the linear model's limitations and assumptions (normality, variance equality).
